	This mod adds mood penalties for wearing bulky armor for a long time.
	The higher the weight, the more comprehensive the coverage and the thicker the armor, the faster a colonist will grow uncomfortable.
	Once mood penalties develop, you can take off the armor to get rid of them. You'll need armor off for longer depending on how uncomfortable the colonist is.
	As you might imagine, this makes the game significantly more challenging.
	Should be compatible with most mods, including armor mods and Combat Extended. Can be disabled without issue. 
	Best combined with a mod that lets you automatically equip armor before battle, like "Gear Up And Go".
